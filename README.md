Questions : 
1]Based on 2 inputs strings (var1 and var2), you need to return var1 if var1 is part of var2 or you need to return var2 if var2 is part of var1 or return "neither variable is a part of other". 
For e.g. var1 = sat@google.com and Var2 = google.com then you need to return var2

2]Based on 2 inputs values (transactionamount, transactioncount), we need you to return score = 0 if (transactionamount < 1000, transactioncount < 5) or you need to return score = 50 
if (transactionamount >= 1000 but less than 10000 & transactioncount >=5 but less than 10) else score = 100.
